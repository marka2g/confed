Feature: Event list 
  In order to find events available on the site 
  As a site viewer
  I want to see events in a browsable list

#  Scenario: Newest released entries on homepage
#    Given there are 15 presentations
#    And   there are 5 unreleased presentations
#    When I am on the homepage
#    Then I should see 10 presentation listings
#    And  I should see 2 pagination links
