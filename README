Conference Education

Goal:
Have a main source for video/presentation slides of conferences

Ideas:
* Talk show page would ideally have video and slides embedded
  * Title, conference info, description of talk
  * Information on speaker
* Conference view would ideally have talks presented in order that they happened. 
* Speakers should be referenced throughout the site so that someone could pull up a specific speaker and see all presentations
* subdomains for conferences?
* allow a conference to style their scoped page
* speaker rating system... I believe there are already services for this, maybe we can take advantage of api
* searchable and/or tagging system
* if there is demand, a conference page could be created as a placeholder so only the video/slide content would need to be embedded when ready
* Is there any reason user group content would not fit into this service as well?

* What are the most used video services for conference videos?
  * Vimeo
  * Blip.tv
  * Viddler
* What are the most used slide sharing services
  * Slideshare

Obviously it will take some curation on our part at first, but hopefully it will provide a great service to many communities and people will want to add their content on their own
